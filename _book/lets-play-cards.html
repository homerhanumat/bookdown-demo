<div id="the-game" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> The Game</h2>
<p>We are going to introduce an important statistical concept that will be a continuing theme throughout this class by playing a game with a standard deck of cards. In a standard 52 card deck, there are 4 suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Spades, Clubs). Each suit has an Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Half of the cards are red (Hearts and Diamonds) and half of the cards are black (Spades and Clubs).</p>
<p>Here’s the game: A volunteer draws 10 cards from our classroom deck of cards, with replacement. The cards will be shuffled between each draw. The volunteer wins a point for each red card drawn and the dealer wins a point for each black card drawn.</p>
<p>Drawing the cards <strong>with replacement</strong> means that the volunteer will draw one card, record the color, and then put it back in the deck before drawing another card. Doing it this way assures that each color has the same chance of being drawn each time.</p>
<p>Let’s think about a couple of questions before playing. <em>If</em> we are playing with a standard deck,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is the probability that the volunteer will pull out a red card?</p></li>
<li><p>Of the 10 cards drawn, how many do you <em>expect</em> to be red?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>This is our best guess (hypothesis), based on the information we have at hand.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Do we think that the volunteer will draw <strong>exactly</strong> the hypothesized number of red cards?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There is randomness at play when we draw cards from a deck.</em></p>
<p>Okay, enough thinking. Let’s play!</p>
</div>
<div id="the-results" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> The Results</h2>
<p>Suppose that our class drew 9 red cards (out of 10 cards drawn). Consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do these results seem consistent with how many we <em>expected</em> to be red? Or do they seem strange?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you still believe your hypothesized probability of drawing a red card? In other words, do you still believe that we are playing with a standard deck?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although these results may seem strange, this was only one game. We agreed that there is randomness at play here, so our results may have just been a fluke. Let’s test this by playing the game again. Better yet, we can speed things up by simulating the game in RStudio. This way, we can play <em>lots</em> of games quickly to see if the results we got in our classroom game are really that surprising.</p>
<p>We can easily create a virtual deck of cards using the concatenation function. Since we only care about the color of the card (not the suit or the face value), let’s make it easier to count by using a virtual deck that tells us only the color. We’ll need 26 red cards and 26 black cards.</p>

<p>We will randomly deal 10 cards from this new deck using the <code>sample</code> function. The <code>sample</code> function takes three arguments. You need to tell is where to sample from, how many to sample, and whether or not to sample with replacement.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">sample</span>(mycards, <span class="dt">size=</span><span class="dv">10</span>, <span class="dt">replace=</span><span class="ot">TRUE</span>)</code></pre></div>

##  [9] &quot;Black&quot; &quot;Red&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Let’s create a table to count the number of red cards and black cards that were in our hand of 10.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">table</span>(<span class="kw">sample</span>(mycards, <span class="dt">size=</span><span class="dv">10</span>, <span class="dt">replace=</span><span class="ot">TRUE</span>))</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## 
## Black   Red 
##     4     6</code></pre>
<p>Again, this was just one game. We would like to repeat this lots of times to see if our class results were really that unusual. We are looking to answer the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How <em>often</em> do we see our in-class results when we’re playing with a standard deck? * What are the <em>chances</em> (or <em>probability</em>) of seeing our in-class results when we’re playing with a standard deck?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s repeat the game three times.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">do</span>(<span class="dv">3</span>)*<span class="kw">table</span>(<span class="kw">sample</span>(mycards, <span class="dt">size=</span><span class="dv">10</span>, <span class="dt">replace=</span><span class="ot">TRUE</span>))</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##   Black Red
## 1     7   3
## 2     4   6
## 3     2   8</code></pre>
<p>The first row of this table represents the first game in which 7 black cards were drawn and 3 red cards were drawn. The second row of this table represents the second game in which 4 black cards were drawn and 6 red cards were drawn. The third row of this table represents the third game in which 2 black cards were drawn and 8 red cards were drawn. If you wanted to simulate more games, you could change the 3 in the line of code above. For example, suppose you wanted to simulate 20 games. You would simply type:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">do</span>(<span class="dv">20</span>)*<span class="kw">table</span>(<span class="kw">sample</span>(mycards, <span class="dt">size=</span><span class="dv">10</span>, <span class="dt">replace=</span><span class="ot">TRUE</span>))</code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s look at this another way by creating a table that keeps track of how many of our games result in a certain number of red cards drawn.</p>
<pre><code>## Red
##  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 
##  0  0  0  1  0  0  1  0  1  0  0</code></pre>
<p>The first row of this table represents the number of red cards drawn. The second row gives the number of games (out of the three that we played) that resulted in drawing that many red cards. We had one game where 3 red cards were drawn, one game where 6 red cards were drawn, and one game where 8 red cards were drawn.</p>
<p>We could get an even better idea of what’s going on if we could simulate the game many times, say 1000 times! We will create the same type of table we just did to keep track of these games.</p>
<pre><code>## Red
##   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10 
##   0   5  41 119 205 249 209 121  42   8   1</code></pre>
<p>At this point, it’s starting to seem that drawing a high number of red cards doesn’t happen very often. It seems unlikely, but it sure would be nice to have an idea of just how unlikely it is.</p>
<p>Perhaps having this table in terms of percents is more useful:</p>
<pre><code>##    
## Red 0   1   2    3    4    5    6    7   8   9  10 Total
##     0 0.5 4.1 11.9 20.5 24.9 20.9 12.1 4.2 0.8 0.1   100</code></pre>
<p>Consider the following questions based on our simulation:</p>
<p>If we draw 10 cards from a standard deck,</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the estimated <em>chance</em> of drawing 5 red cards?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answer: There is a 24.9% chance of drawing 5 red cards.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the estimated <em>probability</em> of drawing 1 red card?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answer: There is a 0.5% probability of drawing 1 red card.</p>
<ul>
<li>How <em>likely</em> is it that our volunteer drew their original hand, based on our simulations?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answer: Assuming that our volunteer drew 9 red cards, the likelihood that our volunteer drew their original hand (based on our simulations) is 0.8%.</p>
<p><strong>Based on this likelihood, does it seem reasonable to believe that the deck we used in class was a standard deck?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s check out how RStudio can help us to visualize the data from our 1000 simulated games graphically, in the form of a histogram. We will be learning more about histograms in Chapter 2.</p>
<p>Here is the table again followed by the graphical representation (histogram). See Figure[Histogram].</p>
<pre><code>##    
## Red 0   1   2    3    4    5    6    7   8   9  10 Total
##     0 0.5 4.1 11.9 20.5 24.9 20.9 12.1 4.2 0.8 0.1   100</code></pre>

<p>The horizontal axis gives us the number of red cards drawn in a hand of 10 cards from a standard deck. The vertical axis gives us the percent of times (out of the 1000 simulated games) that a particular number of red cards was drawn.</p>
<p>Notice that the width of each bar in the histogram is 1 and the height of each bar is equal to the percent of the 1000 games that resulted in that number of red cards.</p>

<p>This colored part of the histogram represents the estimated <em>chance</em> of drawing our particular draw from a standard deck.</p>
<p>We can think about how <em>likely</em> it is that our class game resulted in such a high number of red cards (or higher). This <em>likelihood</em> is called a <strong>p-value</strong>. We can compute the p-value numerically and view it graphically on the histogram.</p>
<p>Numerically, the p-value is:</p>
<pre><code>## Warning: &#39;proptable&#39; is deprecated.

<pre><code>##     9

<p>The p-value is the estimated <em>probability</em> of drawing as many red cards or more (out of 10) as our volunteer drew if we are drawing from a standard deck of playing cards.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>We started with a hypothesis. We assumed that we were playing with a standard deck.</p></li>
<li><p>We gathered data from a real-world experiment to test our hypothesis. We played one real game.</p></li>
<li><p>Our results seemed strange, so we wondered if our hypothesis was true. We questioned: How likely was it to draw the hand that we did if we drew from a standard deck?</p></li>
<li><p>We tested the hypothesis by simulating 1000 games using R. We counted up the number of games that gave us the result we got in class.</p></li>
<li><p>We calculated a P-value, the probability of getting results as extreme as ours (or more so!) from a standard deck.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, we need to draw a conclusion.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Conclusion: If we assume that our volunteer drew 10 cards from a standard deck of cards, there is about a 0.009 (0.9 %) chance of drawing 9 red cards. Since the probability of drawing 9 (or more) red cards is so small, this should cause you to question whether the volunteer was really drawing from a standard deck.</p>
