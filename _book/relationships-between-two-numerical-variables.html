<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Outline</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter, we investigated methods for describing relationships between two <em>factor</em> variables, using</p>
<ul>
<li>twoway tables and row percents for numerical desriptive statistics;</li>
<li>barcharts for graphical descitpive statistics;</li>
<li>the chi-square test, for inference.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this chapter, we are interested in describing relationships between <strong>two</strong> <em>numerical</em> variables.</p>
<p>In chapter 2, we learned about methods to graphically and numerically summarize <strong>one</strong> numerical variable. The methods we used were:</p>
<p><strong>Graphical</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Histogram</li>
<li>Density Plot</li>
<li>Stem Plot</li>
<li>Box Plot (and the really cool Violin Plot)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Numerical</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Median</li>
<li>Percentiles (quantiles)</li>
<li>5-number summary</li>
<li>Mean</li>
<li>SD</li>
<li>IQR</li>
</ul>
<p>We will now be learning to describe how <em>two numerical variables</em> relate to one another. Throughout this chapter, we’re going to work with three different datasets: <code>m111survey</code>, <code>pennstate1</code>, and <code>ucdavis1</code>. The datasets <code>pennstate1</code> and <code>ucdavis1</code> are both surveys of students at their respective schools, very similar to what we’ve seen in <code>m111survey</code>. You can put these datasets into your Global Environment, take a quick look at them, and learn more about them with:</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Statistical Relationships</h2>
<p>When we look at relationships between numerical variables, there are 2 main kinds of relationships that interest us.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Deterministic</em> relationships</li>
<li><em>Statistical</em> relationships</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Deterministic</em> relationships are the type you are used to seeing in algebra class. In this kind of relationship, the value of one variable can be <em>exactly</em> determined by the value of the other variable.</p>
<p>For example, consider the relationship between degrees Fahrenheit and degrees Celcius. If <span class="math inline">\(y= ^\circ\)</span> C and <span class="math inline">\(x= ^\circ\)</span> F, the deterministic relationship can be written</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y=\frac{5}{9}(x-32).\]</span></p>
<p>The degrees Celcius (<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>) is <em>exactly</em> determined by knowing the degrees Fahrenheit (<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>). The graph of this equation is a line. See Figure [Deterministic Relationship].</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:fcplot"></span>
<img src="bookdown-demo_files/figure-html/fcplot-1.png" alt="Deterministic Relationship.  This graph shows the relationship between Fahrenheit and Celcius." width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 4.1: Deterministic Relationship. This graph shows the relationship between Fahrenheit and Celcius.
</p>
</div>
<p>We can see from the graph that there is no variation in the pattern. Every temperature in Fahrenheit has exactly one corresponding temperature in Celcius. We might regard Fahrenheit and Celcius as having a perfect relationship.</p>
<p><em>Statistical</em> relationships are the ones that we will study in this class. In this kind of relationship, there is variation from the average pattern. If we know the value of one variable, we can <em>estimate</em> the typical value of the other variable. However, this is only an estimation. There is no certainty!</p>
<p>For example, suppose we want to use the length of a person’s right handspan (the measurement of one’s outstretched right hand from thumb to pinky) to predict the person’s height. There is certainly a <em>relationship</em> between the length of one’s handspan and their height. People with large hands tend to be taller than people with small hands. However, there is not an equation (or a line) that will <em>exactly</em> tell us the height of a person with a certain handspan. Not every person with a handspan of 20 centimeters is exactly the same height. There is variation in their heights. What we’ve just described is a statistical relationship.</p>
<p>There are 3 tools that we will use to describe <em>statistical</em> relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scatterplots</li>
<li>Correlation</li>
<li>Regression Equation</li>
</ul>
<div id="scatterplots" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Scatterplots</h3>
<p>As we just discussed, our intuition tells us that a person with a large right handspan tends to be tall. Let’s investigate this idea with the following research question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Research Question</strong>: At Pennstate, how is a student’s right handspan related to his/her height?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <em>scatterplot</em> is how we will graphically display the relationship between two numerical variables. Scatterplots allow us to visually identify</p>
<ul>
<li>overall patterns,</li>
<li>directions, and</li>
<li>strength of association</li>
</ul>
<p>between two numerical variables. The best way to get a feel for the relationship between two numerical variables is to take a look at the scatterplot.</p>
<div id="overall-patterns" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1.1</span> Overall Patterns</h4>
<p>Let’s use the function <code>xyplot()</code> in <code>R</code> to create a scatterplot of the variables <strong>RtSpan</strong> and <strong>Height</strong> from the <code>pennstate1</code> dataset.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">xyplot</span>(Height~RtSpan,<span class="dt">data=</span>pennstate1,
       <span class="dt">xlab=</span><span class="st">&quot;Right Handspan (cm)&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">ylab=</span><span class="st">&quot;Height (in)&quot;</span>) </code></pre></div>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:xyhandheight"></span>
<img src="bookdown-demo_files/figure-html/xyhandheight-1.png" alt="Hand/Height Scatterplot.  Relationship Between Right Handspan and Height" width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 4.2: Hand/Height Scatterplot. Relationship Between Right Handspan and Height
</p>
</div>
<p>Each point, (<span class="math inline">\(x,y\)</span>), that you see on the scatterplot represents an individual in the dataset - one of the 190 Penn State students in the survey. The <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-coordinate of the point is that student’s right handspan, in centimeters. The <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-coordinate of the point is that student’s height, in inches.</p>
<p>The ‘formula-data’ input syntax for <code>xyplot()</code> should be starting to become familiar to you. This is the same syntax that we used to produce the graphical outputs from chapter 2. <code>R</code> will plot the variable in front of the <code>~</code> along the vertical axis and the variable behind the <code>~</code> along the horizontal axis. Typically, we put the explanatory variable along the horizontal axis and the response variable along the vertical axis.</p>
<p>You can control how the points in the scatterplot appear using <code>pch</code> and <code>col</code> in the <code>xyplot()</code> function. For example, we can make the scatterplot have solid red points. See Figure[Red Points].</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">xyplot</span>(Height~RtSpan,<span class="dt">data=</span>pennstate1,
       <span class="dt">xlab=</span><span class="st">&quot;Right Handspan (cm)&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">ylab=</span><span class="st">&quot;Height (in)&quot;</span>, 
       <span class="dt">col=</span><span class="st">&quot;red&quot;</span>,<span class="dt">pch=</span><span class="dv">19</span>) </code></pre></div>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:xyhandheightred"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 4.3: Red Points: Relationship Between Right Handspan and Height using solid red points
</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are interested in making fancier scatterplots, there are different values of <code>pch</code> that produce various shapes for the points in the scatterplot. To learn more, consult GeekNotes. <code>R</code> will also provide a complete list of all available colors with:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">colors</span>()</code></pre></div>
<p>When we look at the overall pattern in the scatterplot in Figure[Hand/Height Scatterplot], it appears that students with large right handspans also tend to be tall. One question that may arise is whether this observed relationship is simply the result of the student’s sex. On average, males tend to have larger hands than females and also tend to be taller than females. As we did in chapter 2, we can look at parallel scatterplots in separate panels by “conditioning” on a category, such as <strong>Sex</strong>. See Figure[Parallel Hand/Height by Sex].</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">xyplot</span>(Height~RtSpan|Sex,<span class="dt">data=</span>pennstate1,
       <span class="dt">xlab=</span><span class="st">&quot;Right Handspan (cm)&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">ylab=</span><span class="st">&quot;Height (in)&quot;</span>,<span class="dt">pch=</span><span class="dv">19</span>)</code></pre></div>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:parallelxyhandheight"></span>
<img src="bookdown-demo_files/figure-html/parallelxyhandheight-1.png" alt="Parallel Hand/Height by Sex:  Scatterplots showing the relationship between one's right handspan and height appear in separate panels." width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 4.4: Parallel Hand/Height by Sex: Scatterplots showing the relationship between one’s right handspan and height appear in separate panels.
</p>
</div>
<p>We can see that the relationship we observed in the original scatterplot seems to hold separately for both males and females.</p>
<p>Parallel scatterplots can sometimes be hard to compare since they have separate x-axes. We can “overlay” these scatterplots, using one color for the points representing the males and another color for the points representing the females. Overlaying can be accomplished using the <em>groups</em> argument. See Figure[Overlayed Hand/Height by Sex].</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">xyplot</span>(Height~RtSpan,<span class="dt">groups=</span>Sex,<span class="dt">data=</span>pennstate1,

</div>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Given several numerical variables, R can produce a group of scatterplots, one for each pair of variables—all in one graph. Such a graph is called a <em>scatterplot matrix</em>. For more information, consult GeekNotes.</p>
</div>
<div id="direction" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1.2</span> Direction</h4>
<p>Viewing the scatterplot allows us to detect overall patterns. One way to describe the scatterplot is by giving a name to the <em>direction</em> of the observed pattern.</p>
<p>In the scatterplot Figure[Hand/Height Scatterplot], we could say that the variables <code>RtSpan</code> and <code>Height</code> are <em>positively associated</em> since students with larger handspans tend to be on the tall side and students with smaller handspans tend to be on the short side.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Positive Linear Association</dt>
<dd><p>Two numerical variables have a <em>positive linear association</em> if high values of one variable tend to accompany high values of the other and low values of one variable tend to accompany low values of the other.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>To give a visualization for positively associated variables, let’s add a vertical line that marks the <em>mean</em> of the right handspans and a horizontal line that marks the <em>mean</em> of the heights to break the scatterplot into four “boxes”. See Figure[Positive Association].</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:positivexyhandheight"></span>
<img src="bookdown-demo_files/figure-html/positivexyhandheight-1.png" alt="Positive Association: Most of the points are in the upper right and lower left box showing a positive association between the variables." width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 4.6: Positive Association: Most of the points are in the upper right and lower left box showing a positive association between the variables.
</p>
</div>
<p>Notice that there are more points in the upper right box and lower left box than in the other two boxes. The upper right box includes points from individuals with higher than average right handspans <strong>and</strong> higher than average heights. The lower left box includes points from individuals with lower than average right handspans <strong>and</strong> lower than average heights. When most of the points in a scatterplot are located in these two boxes, the variables have a positive linear association.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Negative Linear Association</dt>
<dd><p>Two variables have a <em>negative linear association</em> if high values of one variable tend to accompany low values of the other and low values of one variable tend to accompany high values of the other.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Let’s take a look at an example of negatively associated variables from the <code>m111survey</code> dataset - <code>GPA</code> and <code>height</code>.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:negativexyhandheight"></span>
<img src="bookdown-demo_files/figure-html/negativexyhandheight-1.png" alt="Negative Association: Most of the points are in the lower right and upper left box showing a negative association between the variables." width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 4.7: Negative Association: Most of the points are in the lower right and upper left box showing a negative association between the variables.
</p>
</div>
<p>Notice that in this scatterplot, there are more points in the upper left box and the lower right box. (See Figure[Negative Association].) The upper left box includes points from individuals with lower than average GPA’s <strong>and</strong> higher than average heights.

<p>In the scatterplot in Figure[No Association], it appears that all of the boxes have <em>about</em> the same number of points in them. When this is the case, the variables have <em>no linear association</em>.</p>
<p>So far we have been interested in variables that appear to have a <em>linear association</em>, and our goal has been to describe the linear association that we see in a scatterplot using the equation of straight line. Data with nonlinear association certainly exists! For example, <em>curvilinear</em> data follows the trend of a curve, rather than a line. You can see an example of this by looking at the <code>fuel</code> dataset. Read the <code>help</code> file on this data to understand what the variables are.</p>

<p>The scatterplot clearly shows that this data would not be well represented by a line. (See Figure[Curvilinear].) As a vehicle’s speed increases up to about 60 kph, the amount of fuel required to travel 100 kilometers decreases. However, as a vehicle’s speed increases from about 60 kph, the fuel efficiency increases: this is one type of curvilinear relationship. We will offer a rudimentary discussion of nonlinear relationships later on in this Chapter.</p>

<p>These scatterplots both display 2 variables that are <em>positively</em> associated, but there is less “scatter” in the second plot.

<p>Since we are interested in how a mother’s height is related to a father’s height, we will treat <strong>dadheight</strong> as the explanatory variable and <strong>momheight</strong> as the response variable. We will start by taking a look at the scatterplot. See Figure[Mom/Dad Height].</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3</span> Regression Equation</h3>
<p><em>Regression analysis</em> is used to numerically explain the linear relationship between two numerical variables using the equation of a line. It is much more specific than the visual analysis we’ve been making by looking at scatterplots.</p>
<p>Recall that the equation of the line <span class="math inline">\(y=\frac{5}{9}(x-32)\)</span> was used to describe the <em>deterministic</em> relationship between degrees Celcius and degrees Fahrenheit. This equation let us determine the <em>exact</em> temperature in Celcius by knowing the temperature in Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>The <em>regression equation</em> is the equation of a line that is used to <em>predict</em> the value for the response variable (<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>) from a known value of the explanatory variable (<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>) in a <em>statistical</em> relationship. It describes how, <em>on average</em>, the response variable is related to the explanatory variable.</p>
<p>In general, the equation of the regression line is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat{y}=a+bx,\]</span></p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the <em><span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-intercept</em>. (The <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-intercept is the point where the line crosses the vertical axis. It is the height of the line at <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>.)</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the <em>slope</em>. (The slope is the inclination or orientation of the line. It is calculated by the ratio <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\mbox{rise}}{\mbox{run}}\)</span>.)</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the known value of the explanatory variable.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}\)</span> is the <em>predicted</em> value of the response variable.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The regression line is the line that best approximates the data in the scatterplot. Returning to our original research question involving the variables <strong>Height</strong> and <strong>RtSpan</strong> from the <code>pennstate1</code> dataset, let’s take a look at the regression line. See Figure[Hand/Height Regression Line].</p>

<p>You can see how the regression line in Figure[Hand/Height Regression Line] seems to do a good job describing the trend of the points in the scatterplot. In fact, it “best fits” the data. The regression (best fit) line is the line that is collectively the closest, in terms of vertical measurement, to all of the points on the scatterplot. These vertical measurements are called <em>residuals</em>. Residuals measure the size of the prediction errors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Research Question</strong>: What is the predicted height of a Pennstate student with a right handspan measurement of 22 cm?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have already seen the graph of the regression line in Figure[Hand/Height Regression Line]. Now, we would like to know the equation for this line. R has a built in function, <code>lmGC()</code>, to compute this equation. (The <code>lm</code> stands for “linear model”.) This function also has the option to graph the regression line (set <code>graph=TRUE</code>).</p>

<p>So the equation of our regression line is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat{y}=41.959349+1.239448 x\]</span></p>
<p>We can now answer the research question two different ways. We can use R as a calculator and plug <span class="math inline">\(x=22\)</span> into the equation above.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="fl">41.95935+1.239448</span>*<span class="dv">22</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 69.22721</code></pre>
<p>A Penn State student with a right handspan of 22 centimeters will have a predicted height of 69.22721 inches.</p>
<p>Another way to do this is using the <code>predict()</code> function. The <code>predict()</code> function requires two inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>a linear model,</li>
<li>a value of the explanatory variables, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to use the <code>predict()</code> function, you should store your linear model in a variable.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">handheightmod &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">lmGC</span>(Height~RtSpan,<span class="dt">data=</span>pennstate1)

<pre><code>## Predict Height is about 69.23,
## give or take 3.158 or so for chance variation.</code></pre>
<p>In addition to the prediction, R gives you a <em>prediction standard error</em> — a rough estimate of how much your prediction of the person’s height is liable to differ from his or her actual height. In general, the regression line’s prediction could easily differ from the actual <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> value (the height) by as much as a couple of prediction standard errors.</p>
<p>If you would like to have a better feel for where the actual value of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> might lie, consider asking for a <em>prediction interval</em>, as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">predict</span>(handheightmod,<span class="dv">22</span>,<span class="dt">level=</span><span class="fl">0.95</span>)</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## Predict Height is about 69.23,
## give or take 3.158 or so for chance variation.
## 
## 95%-prediction interval:
##           lower.bound         upper.bound          
##           62.997191           75.457220</code></pre>
<p>You can be about 95%-confident that the actual height of a person with a handspan of 22 centimeters is somewhere between 63 and 74.5 inches — the stated bounds of the 95%-prediction interval above.</p>
<p>You can ask for prediction intervals at any level of confidence between 0% and 100%,simply by varying the value of the <code>level</code> parameter. For an 80%-prediction interval, run the command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">predict</span>(handheightmod,<span class="dv">22</span>,<span class="dt">level=</span><span class="fl">0.80</span>)</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## Predict Height is about 69.23,
## give or take 3.158 or so for chance variation.
## 
## 80%-prediction interval:
##           lower.bound         upper.bound          
##           65.165568           73.288843</code></pre>
<p>The prediction interval is narrower than before, but you pay a price for the extra precision: now you are only 80%-confident that the actual height lies somewhere inside of the interval.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3.4</span> How Well does our Regression Line fit?</h4>
<p>If all the data in a scatterplot lie <em>exactly on</em> the regression line, we say that our regression line perfectly explains the data. However, this is rarely the case. We usually have points that do not lie on the regression line. Anywhere that this happens, we have <em>variation</em> that is not explained by the regression line. If the data is not on a line, then a line will not be a <em>perfect</em> explanation of the data.</p>
<p>One way we can measure this variation is the <em>residual standard error</em> — sometimes called RSE, or even <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, for short. This quantity does exactly what its name implies - it measures the <em>spread</em> of the residuals (those vertical distances between observations and the regression line). This value is in the output of the <code>lmGC</code> function.</p>
<p>However, we run into a problem when using the residual standard error to measure the variation in the plot. The residual standard error for the <strong>Height</strong> and <strong>RtSpan</strong> data from <code>pennstate1</code> is 3.148589.</p>

<p>For this model, the unit of measure for height is inches. Consider what happens when we change this model by converting the unit of measure for height to feet. Take a look at the scatterplots and regression lines for these two models. See Figure[Different Units].</p>

<p>This change in unit of the response variable does not affect the way the scatterplot of regression line looks. The regression line did an equally good job of fitting the data, in both scatterplots. It does, however, directly affect the value of the residuals. The residuals in the first plot have a much larger value than the residuals in the second plot. This causes the <em>spread</em> of the residuals (the residual standard error) to be bigger in the first plot. Hence, residual standard error is not the best way of measuring the variation accounted for by the regression line.</p>
<p>Another measure of the “explained variation” in the scatterplot is the <em>squared correlation</em>, <span class="math inline">\(r^2\)</span>. This also measures how well our regression line fits the data. However, it tells us the <em>proportion</em> of variation in the response variable that is explained by the explanatory variable. A change in unit (or scale) will not affect the value of <span class="math inline">\(r^2\)</span>.</p>

<p>There a positive correlation between height and top speed. However, this does not necessarily mean that being tall <em>causes</em> you to drive faster. It’s certainly not the case that tall people can’t help but have a heavy foot! There may be a confounding variable that is (at least partially) responsible for the observed association. One possible confounder is <strong>sex</strong>. See Figure[Height/Fastest by Sex]. This suggests that males tend to drive faster than females. Since males also tend to be taller than females, this helps to explain the pattern we saw in the original scatterplot.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Our regression analysis suggests that as teachers are paid higher salaries, the average SAT score drops. However, our intuition tells us that higher salaries would attract better teachers, who in turn would better prepare students for the SAT. What’s going on here?</p>
<p>Use the following app to investigate what happens when we take into account a third variable, <code>frac</code>. This is the percentage of students in the state who take the SAT.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">require</span>(manipulate)
<span class="kw">DtrellScat</span>(sat~salary|frac,<span class="dt">data=</span>sat)</code></pre></div>
<p>We can see that within most subgroups, the slope of the regression line is positive, while the regression line for the overall data has a negative slope.</p>
<p>How can we explain this paradox?</p>
<p><strong>First Observation:</strong> It turns out that states where education is considered a high priority pay their teachers higher salaries. But since education is a high priority in these states, a high proportion of students in these states want to go to college, so a high proportion of them take the SAT. Similarly, states where education isn’t such an important part of the economy or the culture tend to pay their teachers less, and they also tend to have fewer students taking the SAT. So we’ve got a <strong>positive</strong> association between <strong>frac</strong> and <strong>salary</strong>.</p>
<p>Check this out in Figure[Frac/Salary Scatterplot].</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:salaryfracxy"></span>
<img src="bookdown-demo_files/figure-html/salaryfracxy-1.png" alt="Frac/Salary Scatterplot:  Percentage of students in the state that take the SAT vs. the average annual teacher salary." width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 4.25: Frac/Salary Scatterplot: Percentage of students in the state that take the SAT vs. the average annual teacher salary.
</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Second Observation</strong>: When a high percentage of students in a state take the SAT, this pool of test-takers is bound to include both the very strong students and those who are not so strong, so the mean SAT score is liable to be low. On the other hand, in states where fewer students take the SAT, the students who opt to take the test are likely to be highly motivated, definitely college-bound, very studious individuals. This elite pool tends to boost the mean SAT score for the state. So we’ve got a <strong>negative</strong> association between <strong>frac</strong> and <strong>sat</strong>.</p>
<p>Again, check this out in Figure[Frac/SAT Scatterplot].</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:satfracxy"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 4.26: Frac/SAT Scatterplot: Percentage of students in the state that take the SAT vs. the average cumulative SAT score.
</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, put it together: the positive association between <strong>salary</strong> and <strong>frac</strong> and the negative association between <strong>frac</strong> and <strong>sat</strong> results in the negative association between <strong>salary</strong> and <strong>sat</strong>.</p>
<p>To put it in a nontechnical nutshell: states where education is important tend to pay their teachers well, but they also “handicap” themselves by encouraging most students (including the weaker ones) to take tests like the SAT. The handicap is so pronounced that higher values of <strong>salary</strong> tend to go along with lower values of <strong>sat</strong>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Curvilinear Fits</h2>
<p>Frequently we have brought up the idea that the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> — our two numerical variables — might not be a linear one. Let’s look into this idea bit further.</p>
<p>Consider the data frame <code>henderson</code> from the <code>tigertats</code> package:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">data</span>(henderson)

<p>Ricky Henderson, who played in the Major Leagues from 1979 to 2003, is widely considered to be one of the finest leadoff hitters in baseball history. The <code>henderson</code> data frame gives some fo his most important offensive statistics, by season. Let’s have a look at his slugging average (the average number of bases he got per at-bat) over the years (see Figure [Career Slugging]:</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:hendslugplot"></span>
<img src="bookdown-demo_files/figure-html/hendslugplot-1.png" alt="Slugging for Ricky Henderson, 1979-2001" width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 4.27: Slugging for Ricky Henderson, 1979-2001
</p>
</div>
<p>We have included a regression line, but as you can see the fit doesn’t look right at all: the points on the scatter plot don’t appear to follow a line. It’s not just that there is a lot of “scatter” around the regression line; instead it seems that some other pattern – not a linear one — is at work in determining how Ricky’s slugging average varied over the years.</p>
<p>One way to confirm our suspicion is to run a <em>check</em> on the linear fit, using the <code>check</code> parameter for <code>lmGC()</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">lmGC</span>(SLG~Season,<span class="dt">data=</span>henderson,<span class="dt">check=</span><span class="ot">TRUE</span>)</code></pre></div>

<p><img src="bookdown-demo_files/figure-html/hendsluglinecheck-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>In addition to the usual linear model information, the scatter plot contains two new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <em>loess</em> curve;</li>
<li>an approximate 95%-confidence band around the loess curve.</li>
</ul>
<p>The term “loess” is short for “local estimation”: a loess curve is an attempt to use only the data itself to estimate the “real” deterministic part of the relationship between the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> variables. In particular, it doesn’t assume that the relationship is a linear one! hence it wobbles around, following the general pattern of the point son the scatter plot.</p>
<p>The confidence band is the slightly shaded area that surrounds the loess curve. A rough-and-ready way to interpret the interval is to say that we are pretty confident that the “real” relationship between <strong>Season</strong> and <strong>SLG</strong> — if it could somehow be graphed on the scatter plot – would lie somewhere within the band. The loess curve is simply our best “data-based” guess at that unknown relationship.</p>
<p>Note that the regression line wanders a bit outside of the band, and is often quite near the edge of it: this is a good indication that the “real” relationship between <strong>Season</strong> and <strong>SLG</strong> is not a linear one.</p>
<p>So we have “checked” the linear fit, and found it wanting. Let’s use our common sense to consider what the “real” relationship might be like.</p>
<p>For many professional athletes, the first couple of years in the majors leagues are tough ones, as they go up against other top-of-the-line players. But after a while they adjust —if they don’t their career stats come to an end quickly! — and a relatively long “peak” period of play ensues. Eventually, though, age and injuries catch up with the athlete, and his/her performance begins to decline.</p>
<p>Hence the relationship between season of play and some performance measure such as slugging average ought to be a curvilinear one, with a rise and then a fall.</p>
<p>Rise-and-fall curvilinear relationships can be modeled mathematically by means of quadratic equations, which have the general form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y=ax^2+bx+c,\]</span></p>
<p>since these equations graph as parabolas. Let’s try to fit a second-degree curve (a parabola) to our data. This is accomplished using a new function, <code>polyfitGC()</code>. The function works like <code>lmGC()</code>, but has a new parameter <code>degree</code> to indicate the degree of the fitting curve:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>degree=2</code> fits a quadratic (a one-humped rise/fall or fall/rise parabola ) to the data;</li>
<li><code>degree=3</code> fits a cubic (as many as two “humps”“);</li>
<li><code>degree=4</code> fits a cubic (as many as three “humps”“);</li>
<li>and so on to higher degrees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the R-code for our quadratic fit:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">polyfitGC</span>(SLG~Season,<span class="dt">data=</span>henderson,
          <span class="dt">degree=</span><span class="dv">2</span>,<span class="dt">graph=</span><span class="ot">TRUE</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>The output to the console does not give the equation of the parabola, but we do get the residual standard error and the <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> value. (Note that there is no correlation: <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> doesn’t make sense outside the context of linear fits.)</p>
<p>The graph looks promising: the parabola does appear to run through the points on the scatter plot a lot better than the line did. Also note that the <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> value is a good bit higher than it was with the linear fit (0.3825 as compared to 0.0739).</p>
<p>We can check this new fit as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">polyfitGC</span>(SLG~Season,<span class="dt">data=</span>henderson,

<p>Examining Figure [Checking Graph], we see that the parabola stays well within the band at all times: our quadratic fit looks quite promising as a way to predict <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> values from known <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> values!</p>
<p>The the data go only up through the 2001 season, but Henderson played 72 games with the Boston Red Sox in 2002, and 30 games in 2003 for the LA Dodgers. Let’s use the parabola and the linear fit to predict his slugging averages for those two seasons.</p>
<p>First, the prediction based on the linear fit:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">linModel &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">lmGC</span>(SLG~Season,<span class="dt">data=</span>henderson)

<span class="kw">predict</span>(linModel,<span class="dt">x=</span><span class="dv">2003</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>Now the prediction based on the quadratic fit:</p>
<pre class="reval"><code>quadModel &lt;- polyfitGC(SLG~Season,degree=2,data=henderson)
predict(quadModel,x=2002)
predict(quadModel,x=2003)</code></pre>
<p>Here are the predictions from each model, compared with Henderson’s actual statistics:</p>
<table>
<caption>Predicted/Actual Slugging Averages for R. Henderson</caption>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="center">Season</th>

</table>
<p>The regression line was better for 2002, but it falls too slowly: the parabola makes the better prediction for 2003. If we had to predict how Ricky would have done had he stayed on for the 2004 season, surely we would go with the prediction provided by the quadratic fit!</p>
